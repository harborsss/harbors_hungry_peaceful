# Harbor's Hungry Peaceful 

## Description 
A "hunger in Peaceful" mod for 1.21.4. Disables passive health and saturation regen and enables Easy-difficulty hunger decay on Peaceful. Does not update the corresponding settings menu tooltip, because I am lazy. 

I mostly made this because nobody had migrated this mod to 1.21.4 yet and I wanted to play on it. 

## Credits 

This mod was inspired by the mod [Hunger on Peaceful](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hunger-on-peaceful) and techguy16's [1.20 fork](https://modrinth.com/mod/hunger-in-peaceful).
