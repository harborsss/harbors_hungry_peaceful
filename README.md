# harbors_hungry_peaceful

## Description 

A "hunger in Peaceful" mod for 1.21.4. Disables passive health and saturation regen and enables Easy-difficulty hunger decay on Peaceful difficulty. 
Does not fix the corresponding settings menu tooltip, because I am lazy. 

I mostly just made this because nobody had migrated this mod to 1.21.4 yet and I wanted to play on it... 

## Credits 

This mod was based off of [Hunger On Peaceful](https://github.com/nok-ko/HungerOnPeaceful) by nok-ko and techguy16's [fork](https://github.com/techguy16/HungerInPeaceful) for 1.20.
