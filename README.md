A "hunger in Peaceful" mod for 1.21.4. Disables passive health and saturation regen and enables Easy-difficulty hunger decay on Peaceful.  
Does not udpate the corresponding settings menu tooltip, because I am lazy. 

I mostly made this because nobody had migrated this mod to 1.21.4 yet and I wanted to play on it. 

This mod is based off of [Hunger on Peaceful](https://github.com/nok-ko/HungerOnPeaceful) by nok-ko and techguy16's [fork]([https://github.com/techguy16/HungerInPeaceful](https://modrinth.com/mod/hunger-in-peaceful)) for 1.20.
